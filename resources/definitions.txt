Additional definitions that can be useful to enhance the RAG.

----------------
DEFINITION: iDDS
**iDDS** is an _intelligent Data Delivery Service_ orchestrating workflow and data management systems to optimize resource
usage in various workflows.
----------------
DEFINITION: Payload (in the context of PanDA)
The term **payload** refers to the software that is being delivered by the system to be executed on a computing resource.
When a PanDA Pilot is launched on a worker node, it downloads the payload and executes it, along with any required input files.
----------------
DEFINITION: PanDA
![PanDA logo](https://panda-wms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_static/PanDA-rev-logo-small-200px.jpg)
**PanDA** (Production and Distributed Analysis) is a workload management system designed to handle the processing of large-scale data
in distributed computing environments, particularly in high-energy physics experiments like those conducted at CERN.
The PanDA system was developed to meet ATLAS production and analysis requirements for a data-driven workload management system
capable of operating at the LHC data processing scale.
PanDA scalability has been demonstrated in ATLAS through the rapid increase in usage over the last decades.
PanDA was designed to have the flexibility to adapt to emerging computing technologies in processing, storage, networking, and distributed computing middleware.

----------------
DEFINITION: PanDA Pilot
A **PanDA Pilot** is a lightweight agent that runs on a worker node in a distributed computing environment.
It is responsible for fetching and executing jobs assigned by the PanDA server, managing the execution environment, and reporting job status back to the server.
----------------
DEFINITION: PanDA Job
A **PanDA Job** is a unit of work that is submitted to the PanDA workload management system for processing.
Each job typically includes a set of input files, a payload (the software to be executed), and instructions on how to process the data.
----------------
DEFINITION: Rucio
**Rucio** is an open-source software framework that provides data management capabilities for large-scale scientific experiments.
It is designed to handle the storage, replication, and access of vast amounts of data across distributed computing resources.
----------------
DEFINITION: Rucio DID
A **Rucio DID** (Data Identifier) is a unique identifier used in the Rucio data management system to reference a specific piece of data, such as a file or dataset.
Rucio DIDs are used to track and manage data across distributed storage systems.
----------------
DEFINITION: Rucio Scope
A **Rucio Scope** is a namespace used in the Rucio data management system to organize and categorize data.
Scopes help to avoid naming conflicts and provide a way to group related datasets or files.
----------------
DEFINITION: Rucio Account
A **Rucio Account** is a user or entity within the Rucio data management system that has permissions to perform actions such as uploading, downloading, and managing data.
Each account is associated with specific roles and access rights.
----------------
DEFINITION: Rucio Storage Element (RSE)
A **Rucio Storage Element (RSE)** is a logical representation of a storage resource within the Rucio data management system.
RSEs can represent various types of storage systems, such as disk storage, tape storage, or cloud storage, and are used to manage data placement and replication.
----------------
DEFINITION: Rucio Replica
A **Rucio Replica** is a copy of a dataset or file that is stored at a specific Rucio Storage Element (RSE).
Replicas are used to ensure data availability and redundancy across distributed storage systems.
----------------
DEFINITION: Rucio Rule
A **Rucio Rule** is a policy or instruction within the Rucio data management system that defines how data should be managed, such as replication, deletion, or retention policies.
Rules help automate data management tasks based on predefined criteria.
----------------
DEFINITION: Rucio Subscription
A **Rucio Subscription** is a mechanism within the Rucio data management system that allows users to automatically receive notifications or updates about changes to specific datasets or files.
Subscriptions can be used to monitor data availability or changes in data status.
